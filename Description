ARDUINO CATCH THE LIGHT GAME
Author: Trenton Letz

This is a fun little project you can do if you have an Arduino, some LEDs,
a Button, and a Switch! If you don't have a switch, you can easily remove one
little portion of the code (I will indicate that in the code file).

The Objective of this game is to stop the light on the middle LED. 
To stop the light a specific LED you to have to hit the button. 
Doing so will result in a point being added to your score. 
Failing to stop the LED in the middle of the LED array will result
in a point being added to the wrong category, too many wrong answers
and the game will reset! Oh, and I forgot to mention, with every
correct guess the wait time between the LEDs will decrease causing the
game to move a lot faster!

Feel free to send me any comments or feedback on this project, I
look to be keeping up on it and adding more and more functionality
as time progresses!

Thanks, and enjoy the game!
